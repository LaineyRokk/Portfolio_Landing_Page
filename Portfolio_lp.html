    <p>I have been asked to dedicate a section of this portfolio page to explaining why I am here at Epicodus. This is a very difficult and very involved question as it seems large portions of my life have had to change in order to have arrived here, working hard at this school, struggling but tetermined to succeed at something that does not come naturally to me. I suppose the long and short of it is, despite my wide range of post-high school education, this past year I found myself at a cross roads; either continue on in my study (<em>and love</em>) of psychology, knowing full well I would be spending anywhere from one and a half to upwards of five or more years in school to achieve the level of certification I would need to actually be employable in my field, <strong>OR</strong> find a quicker means of education and certification so I could find a vocation I could enjoy and become highly employable with and then consider my return to higher education later in life when I have the financial means and a stable alternate-carrier path. At this point in time I had a fair stroke of luck as I had recently heard of my fiance's cousin, who upon acquiring her bachelor's degree had realized it was close to useless in terms of employment and had discovered a wonderful new type of school; a programming bootcamp-style school. She said it was very challenging, making her feel both smarter than ever and dumb as a stump at the same time. However she perceivered and only a little over a year after graduating this bootcamp school she had been employed at two exptremely prestigious companies and was constantly getting offeres from others allowing her to live a very comfortable life in downtown Seattle. Seeing as how I and my fiance' both had a strong desire to move back to the Portland/Vancouver area I started researching programming bootcamps in the area. Low and behold here I am less than a year later, freshly moved into a new apartment and working as hard as I can less than a week after moving to succeed in this very challenign but interesting field at what seems to very much be the best programming school in the area.  </p>
